Students with significant prior programming experience should consider skipping cse142 and taking cse143 (we allow students to do so without any special permission)",

We will cover topics related to state estimation (bayes filtering, probabilistic motion and sensor models), control (feedback, Lyapunov, LQR, MPC), planning (roadmaps, heuristic search, incremental densification) and online learning. Students will be forming teams and implementing algorithms on 1/10th sized rally cars as part of their assignments. Concepts from all of the assignments will culminate into a final project with a demo on the rally cars. The course will involve programming in a Linux and Python environment along with ROS for interfacing to the robot.",

It is hopeless to understand how software systems work (or why they do not work!) without automated assistance. Programmers need tool assistance during design, implementation, testing, debugging, and modification (\"maintenance\"). This graduate course will investigate a variety of program analysis techniques that address these software engineering tasks. Topics include static analysis (e.g., abstract interpretation), dynamic analysis (e.g., testing and debugging), and probabilistic methods. While the course focuses on the design and implementation of program analysis tools, the material will be useful to anyone who wishes to improve his or her programming or understand the state of the art.",
