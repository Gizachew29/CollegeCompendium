The class format includes lecture, in-class projects, and viewing animations. The emphasis, however, is on in-class critique of ongoing work which is essential to the cycle of visually evaluating work in progress, determining possible improvements, and implementing them for further evaluation.",

Rust derives from a rich history of languages to create a multi-paradigm (imperative/functional), low-level language that focuses on high-performance, zero-cost safety guarantee in concurrent programs. It has begun to gain traction in industry even before official 1.0 release in May 2015, showing a recognized need for a new low-level systems language. In this course, we will cover what makes Rust so unique and apply it to practic systems programming problems.",

We'll look at light reflection from surfaces and scattering in volumes, illumination from luminaires and environments, and diffusion models for translucent materials. We will build working implementations of many of the algorithms we study, and learn how to make sure they are actually working correctly. It's fun to watch integrals and probability distributions transform into photographs of a slightly too perfect synthetic world.",
